## 👋 Welcome!

Thank you for visiting my academic site. I'm **Fernando Andrés Ebensperger**, a PhD student in Fire Protection Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

My research focuses on wind-driven **wildland-urban interface fires**, particularly the behavior of firebrands — the tiny embers that can travel long distances and ignite new fires. Through experimental work and computer modeling, I aim to better understand and predict these dynamics to improve fire safety in vulnerable regions.

## 🔬 Current Highlight

### Intermediate-Scale Firebrand Generation
An experimental campaign using a modular wind tunnel to simulate firebrand behavior under controlled wind conditions.  
📍 Designed, built, and tested at WPI’s large-scale fire lab.

    <h1>My Research at Worcester Polytechnic Institute</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Since January 2023, I've been working as a Research Assistant at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in the Fire Protection Engineering Department. My primary research involves understanding firebrand generation, transport, and ignition behavior in wildland-urban interface (WUI) fires. I specialize in designing, executing, and analyzing controlled wind tunnel experiments.</p>

        <h2>Main Research Areas</h2>

        <h3>Firebrand Generation and Transport</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Design and execution of intermediate-scale experiments to quantify and characterize firebrands under controlled laboratory conditions.</li>
            <li>Development of innovative image processing techniques (e.g., U-Net neural networks) for detecting and tracking firebrands in real-time.</li>
            <li>Statistical and physical modeling of firebrand production rates, mass loss behavior, and aerodynamic properties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Wind Tunnel Development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Led the redesign and implementation of a modular, large-scale wind tunnel to facilitate a variety of fire research experiments.</li>
            <li>Conducted Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and ANSYS Fluent to optimize tunnel configurations.</li>
            <li>Characterized flow conditions (velocity, turbulence intensity, flow uniformity) using advanced instrumentation such as hot-wire anemometry and digital imaging.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Analysis Using UNet-based Image Recognition</h3>
        <p>
            To overcome the challenges associated with accurately quantifying firebrands, I developed an advanced image analysis methodology based on the UNet Convolutional Neural Network architecture proposed by Ronneberger et al. (2015). The model was specifically trained to segment and detect firebrands within experimental videos, enabling precise quantification of generated firebrands across different experimental conditions.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Implemented and optimized a UNet-based segmentation network, trained using custom-annotated datasets from wind tunnel experiments.</li>
            <li>Achieved robust segmentation accuracy, allowing for real-time particle detection and tracking.</li>
            <li>Automated the data extraction workflow by analyzing segmentation results with Python scripts to provide comprehensive statistics on firebrand production and behavior.</li>
        </ul>
